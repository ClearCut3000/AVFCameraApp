# AVFCameraApp
Simple Camera app using AVFoundation.
After the user grants access to the camera, microphone, and photo library, the application is able to record the video, including the zoom supported by the specific device, using the front camera. Points of interest as indicated by the user are also supported. After the recording is stopped, the video plays in the pop-up video player.
